# 📝 Blog Site Django

This repository contains a simple blog site built with the **Django** framework.

It is a basic blog where there is initially only one user who can add, delete, and edit posts, categories, and tags.  
As an admin, you can create more users who can contribute to the blog.

## 🗄 Database

This project uses **PostgreSQL** as the database.

A sample database dump (`blog_db.sql`) is included in the repository.  
To use it:

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database.
2. Restore the `blog_db.sql` into your database using PGAdmin or another tool.

Default superuser credentials:

Username: root 
Password: root123
